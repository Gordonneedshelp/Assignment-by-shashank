## 🧩 Program Logics

A detailed breakdown of the logic implemented in each script:

### 🔢 Number Based Programs
- **Number System Functions**: Uses modular functions and the `math` module to calculate factorial, check for primes, generate Fibonacci sequences, and verify Armstrong or perfect numbers.
- **Prime Number Checker**: Employs trial division logic (up to square root of $n$) to efficiently determine primality for both single numbers and ranges.
- **Factorial Calculator**: Implements a `for` loop to compute factorials while dynamically building a string to show the multiplication steps.
- **Sum & Average Calculator**: Utilizes Python lists and built-in `sum()`, `max()`, and `min()` functions to provide statistical analysis of user-inputted numbers.
- **Multiplication Table**: A simple loop structure that takes a base and a range to print mathematical tables.
- **Leap Year Checker**: Uses mathematical logic `(year % 4 == 0 and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0))` to identify leap years accurately.
- **Number Pattern Printer**: Uses nested `for` loops where the outer loop controls rows and the inner loop manages columns to print geometric number shapes.

### 🧠 Logic & Games
- **Number Guessing Game**: Uses the `random` module to generate a secret number and implements a `while` loop with a limited attempt counter and proximity hints.
- **ATM Simulator**: A menu-driven system using a `while True` loop and conditional statements to manage balance, validation of withdrawal limits, and deposits.
- **Ticket Pricing System**: Logic based on conditional branching (`if-elif-else`) to determine price based on age groups and apply weekend discounts.

### 📊 Utility Applications
- **Bill Splitter**: Calculates total amounts including tax and tip percentages, then divides the final sum by the number of participants.
- **Age Calculator**: Leverages the `datetime` module to calculate precise age in years, months, and days by finding the difference between current time and birthdate.
- **Temperature Converter**: Implements mathematical formulas for conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin within a selection-based menu.
- **Grade Calculator**: Computes percentage from multiple subjects and maps it to a grading scale using nested conditions, also checking for minimum passing marks.

### 🔤 String & Text Processing
- **Text Analysis Functions**: Uses string methods and dictionaries to count vowels, consonants, and word frequency, while identifying the longest word.
- **String Manipulator**: Demonstrates various string slicing and method techniques like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.title()`, and `[::-1]` for reversal.
- **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a string is identical to its reverse after normalization (case-insensitive) using Python's slicing.

### 🧮 Calculator Programs
- **Simple Calculator**: A procedure-based approach to basic arithmetic with explicit error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs.
- **Function-Based Calculator**: Implements arithmetic logic through modular functions, improving code reusability and structure.

### 👤 Basic Profile Program
- **Personal Bio Card**: Uses formatted print statements and escape characters to create a visually structured identity card for students.
